> Notarize Electron applications using electron-builder

For more details regarding the options and functionality: https://github.com/electron/electron-notarize

## Install

```
# npm
npm i electron-builder-notarize --save-dev

# yarn
yarn add electron-builder-notarize --dev
```


## Usage

In your electron-builder config:

```json
{
	...
	"afterSign": "electron-builder-notarize",
	"mac": {
		...
		"hardenedRuntime": true,
		"entitlements": "./node_modules/electron-builder-notarize/entitlements.mac.inherit.plist",
	}
}
```

You can replace the entitlements file with your own, as long as those properties are included as well.

You will also need to authenticate yourself, either with your Apple ID or using an API key. This is done by setting the corresponding environment variables.

If for some reason the script can't locate your project's `appId`, you can specify it using the `APP_ID` environment variable.

### Using `notarytool`

In order to use `notarytool` for notarization, XCode 13 or later is required

  - `APPLE_API_KEY` String - Required for JWT authentication. See Note on JWT authentication below.
  - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` String - Required for JWT authentication. See Note on JWT authentication below.
  - `APPLE_API_ISSUER` String - Issuer ID. Required if `APPLE_API_KEY` is specified.
